"""
Integration tests for Cross-Role Scenarios in AWS Ops Wheel v2

Tests comprehensive cross-role interactions and security boundaries:
- Role boundary enforcement between different users
- Multi-role workflow scenarios
- Permission escalation prevention
- Resource isolation verification
- Cross-wheel-group security testing

Cross-Role Test Scenarios:
- DEPLOYMENT_ADMIN vs WHEEL_ADMIN boundaries
- WHEEL_ADMIN vs USER permission differences
- Multiple users in same wheel group with different roles
- Cross-wheel-group access attempts
- Permission inheritance and delegation testing

Uses dynamic user creation - demonstrates complete role-based security model
